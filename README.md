# tic_tak_toe
sorry in 300 charcters   Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game on a 3Ã—3 grid. Players ('X' and 'O') take turns aiming for three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). It's a quick, strategic game that often results in a draw with perfect play, serving as a basic lesson in game theory and blocking moves.
